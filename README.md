Our project aims to explore the intersection of machine learning and optimization by sparsifying a neural network within the given timeline. Specifically, we'll work on setting as many weights to zero as possible without exceeding a specified accuracy drop on a validation set.

This project involves several challenges:

    Integrating a Neural Network with GAMSPy

    Formulating the Optimization Model
    
    MINLP Formulation (Exploring whether we can simplify this to an NLP formulation would be beneficial) 

    Solver Performance: GAMS is solver-agnostic, so we'll experiment with different solvers, compare their performance, and tune solver parameters. We'll also test if these tuned parameters work for other instances.
